## Setup

1. Get an OpenAI key at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
2. Save it in `BuzzCode: Settings` (access via ctrl + shift + p).
3. Open BuzzCode from the sidebar.

## Using BuzzCode

Provide specific tasks for best results.
Review all code before execution.

## How it works

BuzzCode acts as an AI-to-Computer interface to an OpenAI GPT model. Upon task submission, the GPT model generates a subtask list, which the user can then confirm, cancel, or regenerate. Please note that this process is experimental and may not always produce the expected results.

## Credits

BuzzCode uses [OpenAI's GPT Models](https://openai.com/research/) and json-fixing functions from [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT).

Happy (careful) coding! üêù
