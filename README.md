# TestWise

### Description:
> VS Code extension that enhances Test-Driven Development with Github Copilot via an automated iterative process

### Use Case:

> **Developer:** Writes test[s] for desired component and asks Copilot to generate component that does <X> and passes test[s] <Y>

> **Extension:** Generates the component -> runs the test[s] -> if a test fails, feed codex the failed test, re-generate component until success or a max number of samples has been reached
