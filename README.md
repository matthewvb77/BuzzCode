## Tips and Tricks
To achieve the best results, be as specific as possible.

Please also be careful with what you run! This extension runs real code with real consequences.
 
## How it works

The Testwise extension provides an AI-to-Computer interface to an OpenAI GPT model.

When the user submits a task, one of OpenAI's GPT models generates a subtask list using these interface functions:

- executeTerminalCommand(command)
- generateFile(fileName, fileContents)
- Recurse(newPrompt)

These functionalities allow you to automate simple tasks, save time and focus on complex coding problems.

## Credits

This extension is powered by [OpenAI's GPT Models](https://openai.com/research/) and uses json-fixing functions from [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT). The logo was designed using an owl to symbolize the wisdom and learning aspect of AI.

Happy coding! ðŸ¦‰
