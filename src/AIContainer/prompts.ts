			"type": "executeCommand",
			"parameters": {
				"command": "git clone https://github.com/example/project.git"
			}
		},
		{
			"index": 2,
			"type": "executeCommand",
			"parameters": {
				"command": "npm install"
			}
		},
		{
			"index": 3,
			"type": "generateFile",
			"parameters": {
				"fileName": "main.js",
				"fileContents": "console.log('Hello, World!');"
			}
		}
	]
}

Use the commands at your disposal to generate an instruction list to solve the following prompt by any means necessary:
