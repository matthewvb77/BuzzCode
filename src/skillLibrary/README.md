## Skill Library

This folder contains the skill library. Each instance of training the learner will yield a skill library unique to the job the learner is training for.

Each skill will be a function and description, where the descriptions are stored in a vector database. The skill library will be a dictionary of skills and their descriptions with the key being the skill name and description, and the value being the function.
